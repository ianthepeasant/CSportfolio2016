<h1>How it was made</h1>
<p>This was made using html to create the inputs for the computer and the 
functionality of the calculator. JavaScript is used to create buttons and making 
sure they work properly and make the calculator usable. The use of CSS is used 
to improve the aesthetics of the calculator when used.</p>

<h2>Calculator</h2>

<input id="num1input" type="number" name="quantity"/>

<!--This part of the html is used to build the dropdown list for the calculator so
that when the operator puts numbers in the input slots they can addition, multiplication, etc.
The options allow the user to pick what value they want to use and since the html
does th math for you we can leave it at that. The numinpurs allow users to put the numbers
they want calculated and I separated, with over the options and one at the bottom
to make it presentable on the website and make it easy to understand the what to do.
For the CSS part of the calculator-->
<select id="operatorinput">
    <option value="+">+</option>
    <option value="-">-</option>
    <option value="*">*</option>
    <option value="/">/</option>
    <option value="root">root</option>
    <option value="x^y">x^y</option>
</select>

<input id="num2input" type="number" name="quantity"/>
