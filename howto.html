<h1>The To-do list </h1>
<p> The to do list was supposed to be set in calendar format with settable dates and times that all could be changed on the website.
Behind those settings are  inputs that allow the user to type in the task they plan to do on that day and time along with a delete all button 
to clear past entries and start again. I was never able to create a save button that just copies the text below the input because I was not sure
how to copy elements in to node that allow me to make a copy. I was later told that I had to restart because the I was adding too many extraneous factors,
so I removed the time,date, and input and instead left one input and a color change option for the text. The delete all button still remained
because once you copy the text for later reminders you can erase once done. I gained help from another student who figured how to create a save button
through nodes on html and javascript. Originally the whole website could have worked completely within html because the inputs and the codes needed for the 
other factors worked within the program without javascript. However, changes were made to include the requirements of the assignment and created
a javascript that created a text changer using addEventListener and divs to list out the color that can be read in javascript without hex numbers. The end product
was something more simplified and slimmer than the last, but was able to created into a to-do list which was needed and used javascript functions for saving, deletion and
change color text. The css code for the list is a simple background changes using the url then getting help to make one image repeat without the film affect.
The borders were adjusted to the radius of 5 px and made the inside black and the border a lime green. </p>
<h2>Calculator</h2>
 <p>The calculator is mostly composed of a dropdown list with two inputs with the code for the list in the middle which makes it look
 pleasing along with the css coding. The inputs are coded to take numbers inside the boxes which are taken through input id in html then sent
 through div as an answer. The dropdown list is made in through select id then use option value to give an option for the list. This list
 uses mainly the standard math symbols that you can find on a cheap calculator with the exception of the powers and root. Once the list is
 created you must make them selectable and clickable through javascript with else if statements and variable answers correlating to the symbol 
 and input. The css was also simple by creating the background color green and make borders thick and red to show difference and make the numbers easy to see.
