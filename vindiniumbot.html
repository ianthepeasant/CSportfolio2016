  <h1>What is Vindinium</h1>
        <br>
<p> Vindinium is a arena type game where bots have to capture mines constantly to get the greatest amount of gold before the end of the match.
Each match will have 1200 turns for the four bots to use and when all turns have been used the match will end with the winner being the one with the most gold.
However, unlike most games you will more than likely not have control of your bot because you must program the bots yourself in order for them to work and they will 
be autonomous. You can program a bot to focus on capturing mines, both free and occupied, or by targeting the bot with the most mines; anyway you want. The bots are built
using Javascript and many of their actions are dictated by if, else, var, and task statements in order to guide them to certain goals and follow certain paths within a map, or 
none if you want a wandering bot. The success of your bot depends on how well you built your code whether to be resourceful or ruthless. Happy Coding!</p>
</br>

<h2>My Bot</h2>
<p> For my Vindinium bot I tried to make it more of reserved fighter who is not a risk taker
for most of the game. My coding represents this by making my bot more likely to go to a tavern to heal
when his health reaches 30 hp and will kill a bot if it has the most mines. Here is the code:</p>

<code>
    <pre>
        
        Bot.prototype.botBrain = function() {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        _this = bot;
        
            /*                                      *
         * This Code is global data!            *
         *                                      */
  //These var statements are used to give information the bot may need when it starts running.
        //As can be seen on var myPos there is no specific information it gives and instead gives a general understanding of how some codes may work.
        //These just allow codes further down the algorithm to recognize these variables more readily where you can then add specific instruction with these variables.
          var myDir;
        var myPos = [bot.yourBot.pos.x, bot.yourBot.pos.y];
        var i;

        //This variable allows your bot to acknowledge that others exist in the match.
//The .push function pushes all the enemyBots right next to each other rather than end-to-end like .concat.
        var enemyBots = [];
        if(bot.yourBot.id != 1) enemyBots.push(bot.bot1);
        if(bot.yourBot.id != 2) enemyBots.push(bot.bot2);
        if(bot.yourBot.id != 3) enemyBots.push(bot.bot3);
        if(bot.yourBot.id != 4) enemyBots.push(bot.bot4);

        //Several codes below instead of having .push they have .concat.
//Concat, short for concatenate, links different variables together in series, or in this case end-to-end.
//Since they are separate variables unlike the enemyBots if they were pushed together it would confuse the bot in which piece of information means what.
        var enemyMines = [];
        enemyMines = enemyBots[0].mines;
        enemyMines = enemyMines.concat(enemyBots[1].mines);
        enemyMines = enemyMines.concat(enemyBots[2].mines);
       
        var minesToClaim = bot.freeMines.concat(enemyMines);
        
        var allMines = minesToClaim.concat(allMines);
        
        var mines = enemyBots[0].mines.concat(enemyBots[1].mines, enemyBots[2].mines, bot.freeMines);
          </pre>
</code>
    <br>
    <h2>The Memory of Bot</h2>
    <p>This piece of code is the memory banks of the bot. It is mainly composed of var values which acts as factors your bot should keep track of when doing an action.
    An example of these variables is var myDir where it let's the bot know what directions exist in the game. What it does is access the database that is provided when creating a bot, with assets precoded in c9 vindinium, in order to be used later down the code and remember why the code is there.
    The other codes relatively have the same property where they remind the bot what it is when including certain variables in if statements of the what and how sections.
    The var enemyBots is used to make your aware that there are four bot, but it will not react to them or move towards them because in a var statement it is counting a certain amount of something and not commanding an action like if or else statements.
    Under the var enemyBots is the list of all the bots that would in the game in which you use bot.yourBot.id to to tell your bot to identify the four bots and know that they exist.
    Most of the codes below look different, but it was all in the effort in making my bot recognize mines that are owned by other bots.
    The enemymMines line of codes was meant to find the mines of the three enemy bots not including my own as each bot was counted in order 0 to 3 rather than 1 to 4.
    The information of these mines was then concatenated in order for the information to be put end-to-end to allow the bot to understand the what mine is which in order rather than pushed together.
    Var minesToClaim added on to the need to get mines from other bots feeling that using a similar code as freemines would make the bot go after them as it would have done with freemines
    and the things that are different is name of variable and what it is trying to find in the parentheses. Var allMines also had the same objective as well
    in that the information for all mines, regardless if free or owned, would be known by the bot and once input into what and how sections the bot will go after all the mines on the map.
    The last one is where I got help on in which it already the covers the aspects of the first two codes into one line and labels the var as just mines in general.
    Unlike the first two attempts enemyBots gain a radius in which the bot will react to the mines as shown by [0] and connectting it with .mines. The information in the 
    parentheses is concatenated and within it shows the targets of two particular bot that will have their mines be priority for my bot to capture along with free mines because of last line of bot.freeMines.

         *                                      */
        //This section of the code is used to tell the bot what to do.
        //That usually accounts to giving the bot specific requirements to do certain things like going to a tavern when at a certain hp level, etc. 
        //These requirements are covered with task statements that does not do anything other than act as variables you created.
        //Variables in these tasks are made using if statement to create the condition where something should then using else statement if proven false within the program.
        //When adding if abnd else statements it is important to add and end in curved brackets to differentiate the tasks and codes from each other.
        //If statements give the function using code specified from Vindinium servers that make the bots priortize certain values if they are met.
        //Else statements allows the bot to ignore a task using a if statement and do a previous task.
        
        var task;
       
        //This task forces the bot to look for a tavern at a certain amount of hitpoints.
        //The use of the lesser than sign runs the function of the bot to heal when below 40.
      
       if(bot.yourBot.life < 40){
        task = "lowHealth";
        }
        
        else if(bot.yourBot.life > 60
        && enemyMines.length >0
        ){
            task = "botMine";
        }
        else{
            task = "freemines";
            //task = "captureMines";
        }
          </pre>

<h2>What Section</h2>
<br>
<p>This section uses the global data to ask my bot what to do within certain functions set within if statements which range from gaining health to targeting free mines.
The first task I made for my bot was to claim mines that are not held by enemyBots with nothing else to add except task = "freemines". 
In the What section it requires a minimal amount of coding because you set tasks as var and when you equal something to task it treats it like its own variable. This is the simplest what to do statements because most of the work comes in the how section farther down the code.
However, when it came to healing my bot it required the same process as freemines except you have to specify when you want the bot to get the health usually setting it below a certain hp value.
My bot is set to get health at around 40 hit points to make sure the bot can make it to a tavern after the fight or during a fight. This requires an if statement
with function of bot.yourBot.life to specify your bot's health and then add < to indicate that if your health reaches below 40 than go to a tavern which is done through task = tavern.
Before continuing to the last code block we must notice that at the end of each if and else statement they are ended by a curved bracket and the code block is ended by another curved bracket.
These brackets are used to create the the code blocks and will be prevalent in both the what and how section to activate if and for statements in the later parts.
The last code is an offensive objective of my bot that tells it to capture the mines of other bots when its health is above a certain amount which is represented by >.
Greater than sign gives the bot the instruction that if the bot's health is above 60 than go get mines because I felt that 60 was a generous amount of health the bot can waste capturing mines and still have enough to fight bots to take their mines. 
It can do two things at once within one code block because they are connect by && which signal to the else if statements that there another action the bot can do when over 60 hitpoints.

                    closestTavern = bot.taverns[i];
    }
}
        console.log("Let's get hammered!");
        myDir = bot.findPath(myPos,closestTavern);
}
  </pre>

<h2>How Section</h2>
<br>
<p>This is the how section where it takes the tasks from the what section and creates more detailed instructions on how the bot should go about doing and completeing the tasks.
My code for the first task, "freemines", goes into specifics of what radius the bot should reach in order for it to go after the task which is shown by [0] where the backets confirm the number for the code.
Once you set that radius you must put it into a for statement in order for the bot to recognize this new set value. In my for statement I equate i = 0
to make sure the bot understands the new value and iniate the for statement then set the function to identify this order through length by using bot.freeMines to tell the bot what to do then add .length.
i++ adds increments to allow the bot to go after targets further away and may do this as many times it needs. Below the code blocks there are console.log that will show up on your
feed when completeing or doing a task where you can add your messages to make them funny or just go with the standard statements. Below the console is myDir where you give the 
bot the postion of the objectives you want it to accomplish from its relative position to them through the arrays that represent where the objectives are. 
The later codes follow the same process with differing functionalities and objectives with botMine giving the bot the position of all mines, both free and captured, to make the bot aggressive in taking mines
and attacking bots that try to stop it. LowHealth tells the bot where the taverns are on the map in order for the to use them and are able to set how close to the tavern they have to be in order to heal the bot.

 <code>
    <pre>
         //This code block gives certain directions the bot should go when needed by telling it to go north, south, east, and west.
        //The bot can also go in random directions by equating myDir to none which gives it no particular direction.
        //var dirs then adds north, south, east, west to give myDir direction to go, albeit randomly because it equates to none or no direction.
  if(myDir === "none") {
            console.log("Going Random!");
            var rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
            var dirs = ["north", "south", "east", "west"];
            bot.goDir = dirs[rand];
        }
        else {
            bot.goDir = myDir;
        }
        
          ///////////* DON'T REMOVE ANTYTHING BELOW THIS LINE *//////////////
         resolve();
    });
}
bot.runGame();
    </pre>

<h2>Start Up and Movement</h2>
<p>These last lines of code is what get the bot to move around the map and activates the bot when a match happens on Vindinium servers. 
This is also where myDir, which were added in earlier parts of the code and was added as a variable at the start, can be set for the bot to move around in specific directions during each turn.
It is currently set on none because it did not matter where the bot went as long as it got the objectives is what I cared about, so letting it move randomly was okay with me.
Also since I chose to make the bot stay random there was var that randomized the process by calculating floor tiles randomly to where the bot should go.
OF course, in order for the bot to go anywhere in the first place it must have existing directions to work with which are north, south, east, and west although where it will go is a mystery.
To confirm the movement we use bot.goDir and set it to dirs[rand] to make the bot go in random directions.

<h2>What I Learned about AI</h2>
<p>After going through the process of creating the bot it was a long and arduous task. The first part is the hardest part because even though I used the codes that were given to me when I started I did not understand what for statements were for or how I should label tasks.
When labeling tasks I did not know that you had to title them a different term from other values or else the bot would get confused or the code would just not work.
Another part that was complicated for me was making my bot attack the mines of other bots because I only understood how to get free mines and I figured that using the same code, but switching values and task to make it attack mines of bots.
Did not go as smoothly as I had hoped because I made it more complicated for me to figure out later because I had to create two more codeblocks for what and how sections using unfamiliar terms that I was not sure were going to work at first. 
To understand the programs better and get to my goals for my bot done I had to ask for help: first to give me a crash course in programs that vindinium bot recognize so that I can use them in the future and make them work. The second part of the help
was more troubleshooting my bot going through the code together to find details that I missed or did not realize were mistakes when creating them, which took up most of my time during class. Most of these mistakes were mislabeling of tasks like using bot.tavern for a task name which stopped the entire code from working and was frustrating.
In the end it all payed off because now my bot was able to get free mines, heal itself at taverns, got to taverns when below a certain a number of hitpoints, fight other bots, and capture mines from other bots.
For me it was complicated because I am not familiar with building bots using javascript with most of my experience coming from Scratch which was a simplified version because it had snappable codes to combine. 
When it comes to how I think about AI is that it is difficult if you do not know the language well enough to build bots and I have take into consideration that some of these values and codes were given to me from the vindinium site.
I could not imagine building all that from scratch because making the bots was a challenge for me at first, but also creating the resources and arrays that gave bots directions to go, objectives, and presence of other bots would be something
that would require me to practice for at least half a year before I fell any where ready to comprehend how to do that. In my opinion I give much respect for those who can program bots, especially those who work for big time game developers who have to create
complicated movement patterns, actions, and simulated behaviors of bots in the game to make interesting opponents to fight with and alongside.
